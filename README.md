# Welcome! 
To play Minesweeper, from the project directory run `python src/minesweeper.py`. 

Dependencies:
- Python
- PIL. Run `pip install pillow`
- Pygame. Run `pip install pygame`
- A functional audio driver for sound and music (e.g. PulseAudio if you're on WSL). Without this, the sound system will be disabled.
